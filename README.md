Abstract

•	Collaborated on a critical review of the paper "Demonetisation and Under-Reporting of Economic Activity: Evidence from Real Estate," in the city of Mumbai.
•	Analysed the paper's methodology, data linkage (Propstack, Propequity, IGR), and findings on evasion rates and bunching post-demonetization.
•	Argued strengths in rigorous regression framework and policy relevance, while critiquing confounders like GST/RERA, Mumbai-limited validity, and Propequity proxy issues.
•	Recommended multi-city samples and buyer/seller behaviour research to enhance the paper’s insights.
